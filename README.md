# S2L-Loader

Auto Installer for the S2l codebase

## What it does
This is able to download and install the libraries required into a conda enviorment to prevent any library incompatability.

## Who is this for?

This is for people that are suspicious about the precompiled exe file in this [repo](https://github.com/aftabnadim/S2L). I also made this for people who are too lazy to install S2L themselves. This won't support Linux and Mac and it will never will.

## How can I build it for myself

Clone this github repo

```
git clone https://github.com/python312/s2l-loader
```

Create a folder named **AutomationFolder** in the directory of the loader and name the script that you want to execute **main.py**
if you require any third party libraries just create a **requirements.txt** like usual.
